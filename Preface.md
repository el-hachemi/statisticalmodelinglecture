When dealing with systems involving multiple influences, it is possible
and best to deal with those influences simultaneously. By appropriate
data collection and analysis, the confusing tangle of influences can
sometimes be straightened out.

But a method is useful only when the user has a way to understand
whether the method is appropriate for the situation, what the method is
telling about the data, and what the method is not capable of revealing.
Computer scientist Richard Hamming (1915-1998) said: “The purpose of
computing is insight, not numbers.” Without a solid understanding of the
theory that underlies a method, the numbers generated by the computer
may not give insight.
